# NBA-Player-Stat-API-Web-Scraping

## Introduction
* In this project, I use Python to help me "scrape" NBA.com stats for every player in the NBA. Specifically, I used the NBA Offical Leaders API to get the statistics of * any player from any season. 
* I will go through how I got and used the API to get specific statistics for every player.
* As an example, I will show a valid example and an invalid example of players. 


## Conclusion
* Here, I used Python to scrape NBA.com for statistics on all the players in the NBA using the requests library. I then used the numpy and time libraries to make sure that I wasn't making too many requests. 
* Then, I used pandas to make a dataframe for the statistics of a specific player. 
* This project was fun to complete because I can easily get the statistics of any NBA player from either the Regular Season or Postseason without having to lookup their statistics.
